        (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the
        genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on
        orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys
        on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally
        a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of
        habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its
        offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then
        become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish
        their own. The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once
        ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur
        River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the
        Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century,
        tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and
        have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java
        and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China.
        Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian
        temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian
        subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra. The tiger is listed as Endangered
        on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was
        estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with
        most of the populations living in small isolated pockets. India
        currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for
        population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and
        poaching. Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict,
        particularly in range countries with a high human population density.
        The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's
        charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in the ancient mythology
        and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, and continues to
        be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags,
        coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the
        national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.
